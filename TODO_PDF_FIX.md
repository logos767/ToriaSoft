# PDF Generation Fix - imprimir_codigos.html

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. Fixed SVG Barcode Generation (routes.py)
- ✅ Added `time` import for timeout handling
- ✅ Created `generate_weasyprint_compatible_svg()` function with simple string replacements
- ✅ Removed unsupported SVG properties: `fill`, `text-anchor`, `font-family`, `font-size`
- ✅ Fixed duplicate IDs by making them unique per barcode
- ✅ Simplified SVG generation to avoid regex complexity

### 2. Added PDF Generation Error Handling (routes.py)
- ✅ Added timeout monitoring (25 second limit)
- ✅ Added comprehensive try-catch blocks
- ✅ Added fallback error PDF generation
- ✅ Added logging for debugging

### 3. Updated CSS for Cross-Environment Compatibility (imprimir_codigos.html)
- ✅ Simplified font-family to just 'monospace' to avoid fontTools issues
- ✅ Improved layout with better spacing and flexbox
- ✅ Added CSS Grid fallback for older browsers
- ✅ Organized content into logical sections with proper classes
- ✅ Reduced font sizes for better fit
- ✅ Added proper padding and margins

### 4. Restructured HTML Layout
- ✅ Separated company name, product info, and barcode into distinct sections
- ✅ Used semantic CSS classes for better maintainability
- ✅ Improved text overflow handling
- ✅ Better barcode container sizing

## 🔍 Testing Required

### Local Testing
- [ ] Generate PDF with multiple products
- [ ] Verify 3-column layout is maintained
- [ ] Check that text is not overlapping
- [ ] Confirm barcodes render correctly
- [ ] Test with long product names

### Render Deployment Testing
- [ ] Deploy changes to Render
- [ ] Generate PDF and check logs for WeasyPrint warnings
- [ ] Verify layout matches local version
- [ ] Test with same products used locally

## 📋 Expected Results

After these changes, the PDF should:
1. Generate in proper 3-column layout on both environments
2. Have no WeasyPrint SVG property warnings in logs
3. Display company name, product name, and barcode clearly without overlap
4. Use consistent fonts across environments
5. Handle long product names gracefully with text truncation

## 🚨 Issues Found and Fixed

### FontTools Timeout Issue
- **Problem**: fontTools was causing worker timeouts during font optimization
- **Solution**: Simplified font usage to 'monospace' only, added timeout monitoring
- **Fallback**: Added error handling that returns a simple error PDF if generation fails

## 🚨 If Issues Persist

If problems continue after deployment:
1. Check Render logs for any remaining WeasyPrint warnings
2. Consider using a different barcode library (like `reportlab` instead of WeasyPrint)
3. Test with a minimal HTML template to isolate the issue
4. Verify WeasyPrint version compatibility between environments
5. Check if reducing the number of products per page helps with timeouts
